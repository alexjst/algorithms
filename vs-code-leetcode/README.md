# Visual Studio Code LeetCode Plugin Workspace

This folder contains submissions from my Visual Studio Code's Leetcode plugins.

I will be focus on the following languages: (priorities will change as time goes)

1. C#   - becauase I need prociency here for my work at Roblox
2. Java - because Java is most popular for Internet jobs, but a bit verbose
3. C++  - because this is the most suitable lanauguage for competative programming, most top experts use this
4. Python   - because this is said to be the most syccinct langauge, at the same time, most popular for jobs

For best training:

* Work on problems by type/tag
* Work daily and also weekly on competitions
* Target for company about 3 months before interview
* Do not forget System Design Interview as the same time
* Keep learning, practicing and shaping myself
