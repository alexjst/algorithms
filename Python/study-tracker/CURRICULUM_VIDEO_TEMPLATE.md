## Priority Guidelines

- **High Priority**: Watch BEFORE reading curriculum (20-30 min)
- **Medium Priority**: Watch AFTER for deeper understanding (optional, 30-60 min)
- **Low Priority**: Advanced topics, watch if time permits

## Implementation Notes

1. Add `video_resources` section after `problems` or `practice_questions`
2. Always include: title, url, duration, description, priority
3. Order videos by recommended watch sequence
4. First video should be most important (high priority)
5. Include channel name in title for easy searching
