## ðŸ’¡ Study Tips

### For ByteByteGo Content
- âœ… Pause videos to sketch diagrams yourself
- âœ… Focus on "why" not just "what" - understand tradeoffs
- âœ… Read the newsletter articles for deeper dives beyond videos
- âœ… Use the visual diagrams as templates for your own designs

### For Hello Interview
- âœ… Practice explaining your design out loud as you work
- âœ… Pay attention to level-specific expectations (what Staff engineers prioritize)
- âœ… Note the "common mistakes" sections - these are interview red flags
- âœ… Use their answer keys to calibrate your solutions

### General Best Practices
- ðŸŽ¯ **Breadth before depth**: Understand many systems lightly, then go deep on key ones
- ðŸŽ¯ **Practice estimates**: Get comfortable with back-of-envelope calculations
- ðŸŽ¯ **Draw diagrams**: Visual communication is critical in interviews
- ðŸŽ¯ **Explain tradeoffs**: Never say "X is better" without discussing context
- ðŸŽ¯ **Ask questions**: Real interviews start with clarifying requirements
