    topic: Bit Manipulation
    activity: Master bitwise operations and XOR tricks. Learn bit masking, counting
      bits, and elegant bit-based solutions.
    detailed_content: 'Essential Bit Operations:

      - AND (&): Both bits are 1

      - OR (|): At least one bit is 1

      - XOR (^): Bits are different

      - NOT (~): Flip all bits

      - Left shift (<<): Multiply by 2^n

      - Right shift (>>): Divide by 2^n


      XOR Properties:

      - a ^ a = 0

      - a ^ 0 = a

      - XOR is commutative and associative

      - Useful for finding unique elements


      Common Bit Tricks:

      - Check if power of 2: n & (n-1) == 0

      - Count set bits: bin(n).count(''1'')

      - Get rightmost set bit: n & -n

      - Clear rightmost set bit: n & (n-1)

      - Check if bit i is set: (n >> i) & 1


      Bit Masking:

      - Use integers to represent sets

      - Each bit represents presence/absence

      - Efficient for subset operations

    topic: Top K Elements / Heaps
    activity: Master min/max heaps for priority problems. Learn heap construction,
      k-element problems, and priority queue applications.
    detailed_content: 'Heap Fundamentals:


      Python heapq (min-heap):

      import heapq

      heap = []

      heapq.heappush(heap, item)

      min_item = heapq.heappop(heap)


      Max-heap (negate values):

      heapq.heappush(max_heap, -item)

      max_item = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)


      K Elements Pattern:

      1. Use min-heap of size k for k largest

      2. Use max-heap of size k for k smallest

      3. Maintain heap size by popping when > k


      Applications:

      - Top/bottom k elements

      - Merge k sorted lists

      - Running median

      - CPU scheduling simulation
