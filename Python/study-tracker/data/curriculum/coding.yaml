      detailed_content: |
        Heap Fundamentals:

        Python heapq (min-heap):
        import heapq
        heap = []
        heapq.heappush(heap, item)
        min_item = heapq.heappop(heap)
        heapq.heapify(list)  # O(n) construction

        Max-heap simulation:
        heapq.heappush(heap, -item)
        max_item = -heapq.heappop(heap)

        Common Heap Patterns:

        1. Top K Elements:
           - Use min-heap of size k
           - Add elements, pop if size > k

        2. K Closest/Farthest:
           - Custom comparison with tuples
           - (distance, item) tuples

        3. Merge K Sorted:
           - Heap with (value, list_index, element_index)
           - Always pop smallest, add next from same list

        Time Complexities:
        - Insert/Delete: O(log n)
        - Peek: O(1)
        - Build heap: O(n)

        Advanced Priority Queue Applications:

        1. Merge K Sorted Lists:
           class ListNode:
               def __lt__(self, other):
                   return self.val < other.val

           heap = [head for head in lists if head]
           heapq.heapify(heap)

        2. Find Median from Data Stream:
           - Two heaps: max_heap (left half), min_heap (right half)
           - Balance sizes: |max_heap| - |min_heap| ≤ 1
           - Median = top of larger heap or average of tops

        3. Task Scheduling:
           - Heap of (deadline, task) or (priority, task)
           - Process highest priority first

        4. Dijkstra's Algorithm:
           - Heap of (distance, node)
           - Always process closest unvisited node

        Design Patterns:
        - Use tuples for custom comparison
        - Maintain heap invariants carefully
        - Consider using both min and max heaps

      topic: "Advanced Trie"
      activity: "Solve complex trie problems: word search in grid, auto-complete with ranking."
      detailed_content: |
        Advanced Trie Techniques:

        1. Word Search in 2D Grid:
           - Build trie from word list
           - DFS from each cell, following trie paths
           - Backtrack: mark visited, unmark after recursion
           - Prune: stop if no words have current prefix

        2. Auto-complete with Ranking:
           - Store frequency/score in trie nodes
           - DFS to collect all completions
           - Sort by score/frequency
           - Optimize: store top-k at each node

        3. Trie with Wildcards:
           - Handle '.' as any character
           - Use DFS to explore all possible paths
           - More complex: handle '*' as zero or more chars

        4. Memory Optimization:
           - Compressed trie (Radix tree)
           - Store strings instead of character arrays
           - Reference counting for shared prefixes

        Implementation Tips:
        - Use DFS for trie traversal problems
        - Consider early termination optimizations
        - Handle case sensitivity consistently
        - Be careful with word boundary detection

      activity: "Master 2D grid problems: pathfinding, flood fill, and connectivity algorithms."
      detailed_content: |
        Matrix Traversal Patterns:

        1. Basic Traversal Directions:
           directions = [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]  # right, down, left, up
           diagonals = [(1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1)]

        2. Flood Fill Algorithm:
           def flood_fill(grid, sr, sc, new_color):
               original = grid[sr][sc]
               if original == new_color: return

               def dfs(r, c):
                   if (r < 0 or r >= len(grid) or c < 0 or c >= len(grid[0])
                       or grid[r][c] != original):
                       return
                   grid[r][c] = new_color
                   for dr, dc in directions:
                       dfs(r + dr, c + dc)

               dfs(sr, sc)

        3. BFS for Shortest Path:
           - Use queue with (row, col, distance)
           - Mark visited to avoid cycles
           - Return distance when target found

        4. Multi-source BFS:
           - Start BFS from all sources simultaneously
           - Useful for "distance from nearest" problems

        Common Applications:
        - Island counting (connected components)
        - Maze solving
        - Rotting oranges (multi-source BFS)

           - Trie for prefix matching
           - Heap for top-k results
           - Hash map for sentence frequency

        3. Problem-Solving Strategy:

        Classic Algorithm Implementations:

        1. Kadane's Algorithm (Maximum Subarray):
           def max_subarray(nums):
               max_sum = float('-inf')
               current_sum = 0
               for num in nums:
                   current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
                   max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
               return max_sum

        2. KMP String Matching:
           def kmp_search(text, pattern):
               def build_lps(pattern):
                   lps = [0] * len(pattern)
                   length = 0
                   i = 1
                   while i < len(pattern):
                       if pattern[i] == pattern[length]:
                           length += 1
                           lps[i] = length
                           i += 1
                       else:
                           if length != 0:
                               length = lps[length - 1]
                           else:
                               lps[i] = 0
                               i += 1
                   return lps

        3. Manacher's Algorithm (Longest Palindromic Substring):
           - Preprocesses string to handle even-length palindromes
           - Uses previously computed information to avoid redundant checks
           - O(n) time complexity

        1. Next Greater Element:
           def next_greater(nums):
               result = [-1] * len(nums)
               stack = []  # Store indices

               for i, num in enumerate(nums):
                   while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < num:
                       idx = stack.pop()
                       result[idx] = num
                   stack.append(i)
               return result

               stack = []
               max_area = 0
               index = 0

               while index < len(heights):
                   if not stack or heights[index] >= heights[stack[-1]]:
                       stack.append(index)
                       index += 1
                   else:
                       top = stack.pop()
                       area = (heights[top] *
                              ((index - stack[-1] - 1) if stack else index))
                       max_area = max(max_area, area)

               # Process remaining elements
               while stack:
                   top = stack.pop()
                   area = (heights[top] *
                          ((index - stack[-1] - 1) if stack else index))
                   max_area = max(max_area, area)

               return max_area

               return distances

        2. Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree:
           def kruskal_mst(edges, n):
               # edges = [(weight, u, v), ...]
               edges.sort()  # Sort by weight

        Advanced Graph Concepts:

        1. Strongly Connected Components (Tarjan's Algorithm):
           def tarjan_scc(graph):
               index_counter = [0]
               stack = []
               lowlinks = {}
               index = {}
               on_stack = {}
               result = []

               def strongconnect(v):
                   index[v] = index_counter[0]
                   lowlinks[v] = index_counter[0]
                   index_counter[0] += 1
                   stack.append(v)
                   on_stack[v] = True

                   for w in graph[v]:
                       if w not in index:
                           strongconnect(w)
                           lowlinks[v] = min(lowlinks[v], lowlinks[w])
                       elif on_stack[w]:
                           lowlinks[v] = min(lowlinks[v], index[w])

                   if lowlinks[v] == index[v]:
                       component = []
                       while True:
                           w = stack.pop()
                           on_stack[w] = False
                           component.append(w)
                           if w == v:
                               break
                       result.append(component)

               for v in graph:
                   if v not in index:
                       strongconnect(v)

               return result

        2. Articulation Points (Cut Vertices):
           - Vertices whose removal increases number of components
           - Use DFS with discovery times and low values
           - Root is articulation point if it has > 1 child in DFS tree

        3. Bridge Detection:
           - Edges whose removal increases number of components
           - Similar to articulation points but for edges
           - Bridge exists if low[v] > disc[u] for edge (u,v)

        4. Cycle Detection:
           - Directed graphs: Use DFS with 3 colors (White/Gray/Black)
           - Undirected graphs: Use DFS with parent tracking

        Applications:
        - Network reliability analysis
        - Social network analysis

        - Circuit design
